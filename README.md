# MDP REPRESENTATION

## AIM:
To represent a Markov Decision Process(MDP) problem in the following ways.
1. Text representation 
2. Graphical representation
3. Python - Dictonary representation

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

### Problem Description
Consider a situation a player(AGENT) is  playing in the football field.The aim of the player is to place the ball in goal state.

### State Space
{BAP,BWP,BOB,BG,} - {0,1,2,3}
 where, 
* BAP -> Ball is away from the player.
*  BG -> Ball is in the goal state.
*  BOB -> Ball is out of the Boundary.
* BWP -> Ball is with the player.

### Sample State
 BAP -> 0
*  Ball is away from the player.

### Action Space
{F,R,K} -{0,1,2}
where, 
  * F -> FALL
  * R -> RUN
  * K -> KICK

### Sample Action
R -> RUN

### Reward Function
Reward function = { +1, when the ball is in the goal.
                    0, otherwise.
